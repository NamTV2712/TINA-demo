# agent · worker

The agent worker: runs a single agent workload to completion. Owns the generic turn engine
(`engine`), the per-meeting loop (`meeting`, `meeting_transcript_mcp`), and its container image
(`Dockerfile`). Model/harness access goes through the provider-agnostic [`llm`](../llm) ports —
card beats via `CompletionPort` (a direct HTTP completion), workspace turns via `HarnessPort` (the
`TINA_RUNNER`-selected CLI agent); no vendor name lives in this package. Spawned by the control
plane; liveness = workload lifecycle.

The image installs the operator-owned Codex command-network policy from
`codex-requirements.toml` at `/etc/codex/requirements.toml`. It limits online shell traffic to the
listed GitHub hosts and prevents workspace configuration from widening that list. The adapter
selects an offline profile for untrusted/read-only turns; keep the managed `enabled` field unset.
See [Codex networking](../llm/README.md#codex-web-and-command-networking) for the separate hosted
web-search grant, credential boundaries and verification scope.

Terminal dictation polish is a one-shot, read-only `CompletionPort` job in the worker. It has no
harness tools and does not write chat history or workspace files.

TINA Capture live translation is also a one-shot, tool-less `CompletionPort` job. It receives one
confirmed transcript segment and a fixed target-language code; the source is treated as untrusted
text, and the translated result is returned to the loopback client without writing transcript or
workspace history.

Meeting transcript translation reuses this same entrypoint with one backend-grouped phrase as
its source text. `engine.py` passes the saved `TINA_MEETING_MODEL` override to CompletionPort
(falling back to its configured completion model when absent). The shared `translation_text`
helper removes inline reasoning and rejects unusable output before emitting a message delta.
Failures emit no translated text and do not log the transcript or provider response body.
The private terminal `turn-complete` marker carries an optional fixed `translation_error` code
(see `meeting-translation.v2`); it never carries exception text. Typed adapter status and transport
errors distinguish phrase timeout/output failure from owner-wide auth/quota/service cooldowns.
The control plane accepts translated deltas only after a successful completion marker, discarding
partial output on error or an interrupted stream. Deploy worker and control plane together to
enable this classification; a legacy worker's empty result remains a conservative service error.
The control plane owns phrase grouping, persistence, leases and retry; this worker performs
only the tool-less translation and leaves original/canonical transcripts unchanged.

# Canonical notes jobs

`processed_notes.py` handles the private canonical-window entrypoint before the legacy live loop.
It calls the existing tool-less meeting CompletionPort using canonical text and resolved speaker
names, then emits a candidate result. It does not publish live notes, edit canonical text or
overwrite workspace documents. Meeting API owns source/lease validation and final publication.

Meeting voice planning uses a bounded read-only CompletionPort prompt (`voice_plan`). LiveKit executes the selected tools; the existing final voice completion still verifies every room claim.

Voice review and one optional repair share the remaining completion deadline. No repair runs after verifier outages; every corrected claim and follow-up is checked again.

Recap map jobs use the normal numeric/semantic review and repair; reduction jobs select/compress cited map facts but never authorize evidence. A separate final verify job reviews original transcript chunks. All jobs keep the selected CompletionPort model and existing bounded completion deadlines.

Malformed ordinary voice replies get at most one final JSON regeneration within the same
50-second completion budget. This includes prose around JSON and unexpected tools in a final-only
step. Regeneration receives the original sources/question and untrusted failed output, cannot
execute tools, and must pass claim validation and semantic review. Invalid recovery and provider
failures still fail closed; private drafts are never logged.

Meeting voice uses optional provider-side JSON Schema for generation, plans, review and repairs.
A larger retrieval (>8 excerpts) first gets one optional ranker call with a four-second HTTP timeout,
using the same selected model and authorized excerpts. Rank failures retain the original retrieval;
the ranking call has no capability fallback retry. This call consumes the existing 50-second
scheduling budget; source/numeric/semantic checks and one-repair limits remain mandatory.
Structured `voice_stage` logs correlate ranking/generation/review/repair with the bot request UUID
forwarded by Meeting API and the control-plane dispatch envelope. No content is logged.
