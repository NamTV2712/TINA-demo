# deploy/compose/bin — deployment and gate runners

## Local tina CLI / TUI

From the repo root run `make cli-install`. This installs a symlink at `~/.local/bin/tina` to
this checkout, refuses to replace another executable, and works outside the repo. Add that directory
to PATH if it is not already present. Requires Python 3.10+, Docker Compose and, for TUI, a macOS/Linux
TTY with Python curses. No new Python dependency is installed.

```bash
tina                       # TUI on a terminal; read-only status when piped
tina setup                 # new local install: preview, private config, build/start, optional ASR setup
tina setup --dry-run        # check prerequisites/conflicts; create nothing persistent
tina status
tina doctor --json
tina doctor --full          # Compose + host/ASR/worker diagnostics, without inference
tina check cli              # CLI regression tests; no live-stack mutation
tina check graph
tina check dataflow
tina check contracts
tina check all --json       # four checks, private logs, one JSON result
tina asr status             # global + configured Desktop selection, credentials hidden
tina asr verify             # host/container status, no audio upload
tina asr configure          # interactive scope/backend/endpoint/hidden token + preview
tina plan
tina deploy --dry-run
tina build --yes            # source images only; running containers remain
tina deploy --yes           # source build + activate + readiness + access provisioning
tina up --yes               # existing image tags; no build or pull
tina restart terminal --yes # existing container/image, no recreate
tina down --yes             # remove containers/network, preserve all volumes
tina logs runtime --tail 50
tina logs runtime --follow
tina open terminal
```

The CLI and Make entrypoint share `stack.py`; TUI calls the same CLI dispatcher. ENV_FILE,
DOCKER_CONTEXT, PROJECT and COMPOSE_FILE use the deployment rules in the parent README. The
installed symlink follows this checkout; keep it in place or rerun the installer from its new location.
No separate CLI credential/profile database is created. API meeting/transcript/routine commands
are outside this release.

The ASR controller reports disabled Compose profiles as stopped instead of failing the whole
runtime status request. A Gipformer-only deployment remains controllable without VieGem;
native MPS VieGem is still checked through its host endpoint without a Compose service.

### First installation (CLI 0.4.0)

Clone `https://github.com/poor-frog/TINA.git` or use an existing checkout. On macOS install and
start OrbStack or Docker Desktop. On Linux start a local Docker engine.
You need Python 3.10+, make (for CLI installation), git, bash, openssl and Docker engine >=26 with
Compose supporting `up --wait` and optional `env_file` entries. Builds download dependencies and
infrastructure images and can take several minutes; use a host with about 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM.

```bash
cd /path/to/TINA
make cli-install
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # add this to your shell profile for future terminals
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/tina"
export ENV_FILE="$HOME/.config/tina/.env"
tina setup --dry-run                # inspect the new install; creates no config or Docker resources
tina setup                          # create the private config and a separate tina-local deployment
```

Use the private path above for a fresh install: this checkout already contains an encrypted
`deploy/compose/.env`, so the default setup path exists and is intentionally not overwritten. Setup
uses the local Docker context (or explicit DOCKER_CONTEXT), the base `docker-compose.yml`,
project/image tag `tina-local`, default loopback ports and new Compose-managed volumes. It does not
inherit another deployment's shell settings, profiles, credentials or migration overlay. Optional
Dashboard, Discord and mailbox profiles stay off. Base Compose includes MCP and flows; native
Desktop/Capture and ASR workers are separate. No existing service is stopped to free a port.

The preview checks the engine, bindings, occupied ports and existing project containers, volumes
and network before asking to continue. Setup refuses an existing configuration (including a symlink),
existing project resources and remote Docker sockets. It writes a complete mode-0600 `.env` without
overwriting anything, with new database/storage/auth/signing credentials, then reuses `tina deploy`
for source builds, activation, readiness and access provisioning. Your global Docker context stays
unchanged. Image tags are scoped to the new project; the shared bot build-base tag/cache is reused.

After deployment, an interactive terminal can run the existing global ASR configuration wizard
and host/container status verification. The endpoint/token remain your explicit choice. No ASR
model is installed or started. Skipping ASR returns `setup=platform_ready, asr_ready=false` with
next commands, not a claim that transcription works. Open the printed Terminal URL, create a local
account and configure agent model/subscription credentials in Settings → Models.

For scripts, `tina setup --yes --json` builds/starts the platform without prompts and returns the
ASR commands as next steps. It does not auto-configure ASR or open a browser. A failed ASR probe
returns exit 1 with the platform URL and diagnostics. Build failure or cancellation retains the
config and any created resources: inspect `tina status`, then retry with `tina deploy`; setup does
not reset an installation. The wizard is for local evaluation, not public/cloud hardening.

Existing installations should use `tina doctor`, `tina deploy` and `tina asr configure`. For a new
config path select `ENV_FILE=/private/existing-directory/.env.tina-new tina setup --project tina-new`;
keep using that ENV_FILE in subsequent commands. Its parent directory must exist, and default
ports must be free. If you need custom ports/profiles, prepare the env file explicitly and use
the existing `plan`/`deploy` flow. Do not use the imported-volume OrbStack migration overlay for a
fresh installation. Dry-run mints no credentials and creates no config, images or Docker resources.

### Full diagnostics and repository checks

`doctor` checks Compose; `doctor --full` additionally collects host and ASR diagnostics, even when
a Compose check fails. It resolves global/default ASR through Identity's existing read-only
`/internal/transcription/resolve` operation. Only explicit `deployment` selection may use environment
fallbacks. An invalid account credential or missing named backend never silently selects another model.
When `TINA_DESKTOP_API_KEY` is configured, Desktop ASR uses that account; bot diagnostics use global
defaults and do not claim to inspect every bot user's preference.

Desktop health is read at host loopback :8056. Capture bridge :9099 is a TCP-only probe: reachable
is reported as `not_verified`, without a WebSocket handshake or capture session. ASR `/status`
is checked from the host and the selected stack's Agent API container; tokens stay private and
container probe credentials travel via stdin, never process arguments. Worker URLs come from the
selected deployment; host-only worker env files and actual Capture permissions are not inspected.
`host.docker.internal` is translated to loopback only for host probes.

HTTP probes have bounded response sizes/timeouts, ignore proxy env variables and refuse redirects.
Only allowlisted metadata is returned; no transcript/audio is fetched and no inference/model-loading
job is submitted. `ready` covers required configured checks; `complete=false` highlights evidence
gaps such as an unverified listener. A reachable bridge is permitted with this evidence warning;
a closed bridge fails readiness. Optional unconfigured workers do not fail the command. An
unreachable configured worker or ASR does fail it. A backend without recognized `/status` diagnostics
is marked unsupported, never declared inference-ready.

`check [cli|graph|dataflow|contracts|all]` runs the existing tools from the repo root, independently
of Docker configuration. `check` defaults to all four, continues after a failure and returns a summary.
It neither seals schemas nor deploys. It requires preinstalled repo tools and the existing Compose
test environment; uv runs frozen/offline/no-sync and npm/npx is offline, so it does not install missing
dependencies. Checks create redacted logs under `~/Library/Logs/TINA/checks/` on macOS or
`~/.local/state/tina/checks/` on Linux, with private run directories and mode-0600 log files.
Each check has a 300-second timeout. Exit 1 means at least one failed; `data.checks` retains each
underlying exit code, log path and failure tail. Full-doctor failures similarly retain
`data.diagnostics` in the JSON error envelope. `--dry-run` runs no probes/checks and creates no logs.

The green TUI has Full system check and Repository checks entries using these same dispatchers.

### ASR settings (CLI 0.3.0)

The ASR settings TUI submenu offers status, verify and configure. `tina asr status` shows global
defaults and the configured Desktop binding. `--scope account` uses TINA_API_KEY, or the configured
TINA_DESKTOP_API_KEY, validates expiry/scopes through Identity and identifies the account ID. It never
accepts a user ID as authority and never falls back to global credentials after an account denial.
Status reads effective selection; verify additionally probes the saved host/container ASR status.
Neither command uploads audio, starts a model or changes settings. Active capture sessions may keep
their pinned backend; changes apply to new sessions. Actual per-bot user overrides may differ.

```bash
tina asr configure --scope global --backend custom \
  --url http://host.docker.internal:18002 --clear-token --dry-run
tina asr configure --scope global --backend custom \
  --url http://host.docker.internal:18002 --token-env TINA_ENDPOINT_TOKEN --dry-run
# After reviewing scope/endpoint/credential action, replace --dry-run with --yes to save.
tina asr status --scope account
tina asr verify --scope account
tina asr configure --scope account --backend default --dry-run
```

These URLs are explicit examples, not an auto-selected worker. Interactive configuration lists the
existing backend choices and requests the endpoint/token privately. Missing scope/backend in a
noninteractive configure is an error. An unchanged endpoint preserves credentials by omission.
Changing an endpoint with stored credentials requires a new token or explicit --clear-token, so an
old credential is not silently forwarded to a different service. `--token-env` takes a variable name;
`--token-file` takes an owner-only, non-symlink file with one raw token (not a dotenv file). Raw
--token/--api-key arguments are refused without echoing their values. No credential is stored in a new
CLI config file or printed in previews/results. Avoid putting secrets in endpoint URLs.

Global configuration uses existing GET/PUT /internal/settings/transcription; account changes use
/user/transcription with that account's API key. Custom global endpoints map to the existing
default_backend=deployment slot because the current API does not support a custom default_backend
value. FunASR/Sherpa named choices have URL slots but no token slot; use a custom endpoint for an
authenticated service. This API has no arbitrary per-endpoint model override: status shows the
request alias and verify shows model metadata actually reported by the endpoint.

Configure previews the context/project, scope, before/after endpoint, credential action and affected
new sessions. It requires --yes or interactive confirmation, re-reads settings to detect intervening
edits, sends only selected settings fields, reads back and resolves the result. A missing selected
project/Identity published port fails before sending a settings request. Other scopes and unrelated
fields are retained. The existing global settings API has no atomic CAS: concurrent administrator
edits may still race after the re-read. Failed/unconfirmed writes are not blindly retried or rolled
back; inspect status. Successful save is not proof of connectivity: run asr verify separately.

Read commands never provision tokens. Deploy verifies provisioning like make all and creates a
fresh scoped key; it suppresses the returned credential. Repeated deploys therefore are not credential
idempotent, so failed mutating operations are not marked automatically retryable. Up may recreate
containers when an image/config changed; restart uses Compose restart and keeps the running image.
Build updates tags which Runtime may use for subsequent spawned workloads.

`--dry-run` resolves and validates the target but never builds, starts, opens a browser, mints secrets
or tokens. Mutations show context/project and impact; use `--yes` for scripts. A non-TTY requiring
confirmation returns `confirmation_required`, never waits for input. No command removes volumes.

Output defaults to a table on a TTY, a single JSON envelope on a pipe. `--json` or `--format json|table`
overrides it. JSON has `ok`, `data` or `error`, and `meta.schema_version=1`. Long command output and
follow logs go to stderr; the final envelope stays on stdout. Known configured secrets, common
credential fields, bearer/basic headers and URL credentials are redacted. Arbitrary application text
cannot be guaranteed secret-free; review logs before sharing them. Help/version output is plain text.

Exit codes: 0 success; 1 execution/readiness failure; 2 invalid arguments/confirmation/interactive
requirement; 130 cancellation. Cancellation during a mutation does not promise rollback: check status.
TUI supports arrow keys or j/k, Enter, r refresh, Esc/q exit; it restores terminal modes on exit.

CLI/TUI copy is English. The TUI reads TINA's dark theme from `branding/tokens.json`: deep green
canvas, mint accent and a green selection bar. Colors adapt to programmable, 256-color and basic
color terminals, with a monochrome fallback. Any temporarily changed terminal palette entries are
restored when leaving the menu. `NO_COLOR` disables styling; JSON and piped output never receive
color escapes. Status tables use the same brand accents on interactive terminals.

Tests: `uv run --project deploy/compose/tests pytest deploy/compose/tests/test_make_entrypoint.py
deploy/compose/tests/test_tina_cli.py`. Operational commands must be exercised on an isolated project;
readiness is not a meeting/ASR/agent acceptance test.

`stack.py` owns the source deployment flow used by Make: Compose resolves project/env/overrides,
then all required images build before activation. `plan` and `doctor` are read-only; `all` waits
for selected services and fails if access provisioning fails. It never sources/evals dotenv text.
The same context is used for `down`, status and the meeting probe. See the [deployment guide](../README.md).

`stack-test` is the one entrypoint the `gate:compose` gate dispatches: it detects docker (skip green
if absent), then runs the stack-readiness proof (`../tests/stack_test.py`) via `uv run pytest`. The
proof owns the full up→prove→`down -v` lifecycle itself.

```bash
bin/stack-test                  # always-on subset (the routine gate)
COMPOSE_BOT=1 bin/stack-test    # + the real bot-spawn proof (steps 3·6a)
COMPOSE_NO_BUILD=1 bin/stack-test   # reuse cached images (skip --build)
```

`desktop-local.mjs` starts the native host Desktop against this stack's central ASR settings.
Run `node deploy/compose/bin/desktop-local.mjs` from the repository after building `@tina/desktop`.
It reads the identity port/internal secret from `.env`, binds only to `127.0.0.1`, and keeps STT
credentials server-side. Extension API keys select personal preferences; native capture follows
Global defaults unless `TINA_DESKTOP_API_KEY` binds an account. The launcher puts Desktop's ingest
listener on an ephemeral loopback port and exposes native capture through an authenticated proxy at
`127.0.0.1:9099`. A per-run HMAC secret is written with owner-only permissions under
`~/Library/Application Support/local.tina.capture/`; TINA Capture proves the proxy before starting
audio capture. See the
[Desktop README](../../../core/meetings/services/desktop/README.md) for restart/history restoration.

`sync-transcript.mjs SOURCE_MEETING_URL DESTINATION_BY_ID_URL` explicitly copies one completed
Desktop foundation snapshot into an owned Meeting API source replica. Set `TINA_API_KEY` and,
when required, `TINA_DESKTOP_API_KEY` in the environment. It refuses redirects and non-loopback
unencrypted URLs, reads at most 4 MiB, uses receiver CAS and reports only metadata. No PCM is uploaded.
See [stt-foundation.v1](../../../core/meetings/contracts/stt-foundation.v1/README.md).
Its isolated check is `node deploy/compose/tests/sync_transcript_test.mjs` from the repo root.
